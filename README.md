# **U.S. Housing Market Analysis (2012 - 2024)**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze the U.S. housing market from January 2012 to June 2024 to identify national trends, regional differences, and unique marketplace behaviors. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as median sale prices, sales volume, days on market, inventory levels, and the impact of significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic on housing prices.

## **Datasets Used**
- **Source**: Redfin Housing Market Data (https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/)
- **File**: `data.csv`

## **Research Questions**
1. **Topline National Summary Stats**
   - What are the trends in median sale prices, homes sold, new listings, and days on market across the U.S.?

2. **Fastest Growing Metro Areas**
   - Which metro areas are experiencing the fastest growth in sales volume and prices?

3. **Markets with the Most Motivation to Sell**
   - Which regions show the highest motivation to sell based on days on market and new listings?

4. **Impact of COVID-19 on Housing Prices**
   - How did housing prices fluctuate during and after the COVID-19 pandemic (2019 - 2024)?

5. **Correlation Between Median Sale Price and Homes Sold**
   - Is there a correlation between median sale prices and the number of homes sold?

6. **Highest and lowest YoY growth in median sale prices**
   - What regions are experiencing the highest and lowest YoY growth in median sale prices?

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preparation**
   - The data was cleaned by handling missing values and converting date formats.
   - The dataset was transformed to focus on quarterly data for trend analysis.

2. **Analysis**
   - **Statistical Analysis**: Used descriptive statistics to summarize trends.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Examined the relationship between median sale prices and homes sold.
   - **Trend Analysis**: Analyzed trends in new listings and sales volume over time.

3. **Visualization**
   - Data was visualized using `matplotlib` and `scipy.stats` to create line plots, scatter plots, and other charts that represent the findings.

## **Findings**
- **Consistent Growth**: Median sale prices have consistently increased since 2012, driven by demand, supply constraints, and favorable economic conditions.
- **Metro Area Growth**: Certain metro areas have seen rapid growth in sales volume and prices, influenced by population growth and economic development.
- **Market Motivation**: Regions with high days on market and new listings suggest outmigration, possibly due to economic decline or other factors.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Housing prices surged during and after the COVID-19 pandemic due to low interest rates and changing housing preferences.
- **High and low YoY Growth**: A clear visualization of the Top 10 and Bottom 10 Regions by YoY Growth in Median Sale Prices (2024) and explanation based on researches.
- **Correlation**: A weak correlation between median sale prices and homes sold indicates that higher prices do not necessarily result in more sales.



## **Code Usage**
1. **Imported Libraries**
   - The required Python libraries are : (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`).
   
2. **Running the Analysis**
   - The code is organized into cells for each research question. Execute the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis.

3. **Visualization**
   - The code includes various plotting functions to visualize trends and correlations.

## **Conclusion**
This analysis provides a detailed understanding of the U.S. housing market's evolution over the past decade. The findings can inform stakeholders, including policymakers, real estate professionals, and investors, about the market's current state and future trends.
